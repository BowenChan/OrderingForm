<b>Ordering Form</b>

	This program is to create a system where Clients(Store owners) are able to order products from the Server(Distrubutor Company). Onces the order is recieved, the Distributor Company will then access the Database or Inventory to ensure every product is present and confirm the order. Onces the order is confirmed, the Database will create an invoice for the Distributor to present to the Client

	The Clients will also be able to modify their orders and look into past order.
