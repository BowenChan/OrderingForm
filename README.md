Ordering Form

This program is to create a system where Clients(Store owners) are able to order products from the Server(Distrubutor Company). Onces the order is recieved, the Distributor Company will then access the Database or Inventory to ensure every product is present and confirm the order. Onces the order is confirmed, the Database will create an invoice for the Distributor to present to the Client

The Clients will also be able to modify their orders and look into past order.

Road Map
	Version 1:
		Simply Text format in java which will combine Hibernate

	Version 2:
		Combine restful service and hopefully a running Server/Client Model

	Version 3
		IOS and Android Mobile working application
